Please do these tasks and send me. How many time do you want for it?

1. General knowledge. Please describe what will happen when I input url in browser and press Enter on keyboard  as detailed as you can (start from electrons for example).

2. OOP and programming. "Discount module". There are products A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M .... Each product costs a certain amount.
There are a set of rules for calculating the total amount:
If both A and B are selected at the same time, their total cost is reduced by 10% (for each pair of A and B);
If D and E are simultaneously selected, their total cost is reduced by 5% (for each pair of D and E);
If E, F, G are simultaneously selected, their total cost is reduced by 5% (for each triplet E, F, G);
If both A and one of [K, L, M] are selected at the same time, the cost of the selected product is reduced by 5%;
If the user chooses 3 products at the same time, he receives a 5% discount from the order amount;
If the user chooses 4 products at the same time, he receives a 10% discount from the order amount;
If the user chooses 5 products at the same time, he receives a 20% discount from the order amount;
The described discounts 5,6,7 are not summarized, only one of them is applied;
Products A and C do not participate in discounts of 5.6.7;
Each product can participate in only one discount. Discounts are applied sequentially in the order described above;
Rules can be added, changed, deleted.
It is necessary to write a program using OOP, input set of products (one product can meet several times), calculated the total value of them.
The program should be written as simply and flexibly as possible.
Imagine you created module that will be used third-party companies. You will produce new version with security fixes and new abilities (new discounts for example). Other companies will update previous version of module to new one.

3. Describe how should be organized MVC and why?

4. Implement an abstract singleton, with the ability to implement from it individual singletones.

5. Database. We load statistic from Facebook, and divide spent money by the number of clicks to get cost of each click and save it to database. How should we save it to not lost any cent in total (write db schema and SQL-queries for that).

6. Plz describe how did you use composite index in db?

7. Security. How do you check security of data from client if we need save text description?

Use PHP, Python or Ruby.

Please point how many time took each task (include thinking, coding, testing, fixing, commenting).
